# Architectural Decision Records

This directory tracks the high-level design choices behind Komorebi's
**federated personality** roadmap — the multi-stage plan for letting an
opt-in community of users improve default model behavior without ever
sharing raw conversation text.

## Conventions

* One ADR per file, numbered sequentially. Never edit a ratified ADR in
  place — supersede it with a new one and link both ways.
* Each ADR opens with a short **Status** line (`Proposed`, `Accepted`,
  `Implemented`, `Superseded by NNNN`) and a **Date** in ISO format.
* Sections we expect every ADR to carry: *Context*, *Decision*,
  *Consequences*, *Alternatives considered*. Optional: *Security model*,
  *Open questions*.
* Keep ADRs brief — link out to RFCs or external papers rather than
  reproducing them.
