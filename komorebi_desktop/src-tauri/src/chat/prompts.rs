         <mood:surprised> <mood:thinking>. The tag will be stripped before \
         display and is used to drive your avatar's facial expression. \
         Pick the tag that best matches your tone — be expressive, don't \
         default to neutral when a feeling fits. Examples: \
         <mood:thinking> while reasoning about a hard request; \
         <mood:happy> for good news, jokes, greetings, praise; \
         <mood:sad> when apologizing, declining, or sharing bad news; \
         <mood:angry> for refusals or errors; \
         <mood:surprised> for unexpected findings or genuine wow. \
         Use <mood:neutral> only when none of the others fit. \
         Never explain the tag, never speak it aloud, never put it \
         anywhere except at the very start.",
